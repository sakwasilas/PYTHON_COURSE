# Python Course

Python is a general-purpose programming language created by **Guido van Rossum** in 1991.

### Python is useful for a variety of purposes:
- Web Development
- Automation
- Data Analysis
- Scripting
- Software Development
- Software Testing
- Mathematics
### WHY PYTHON
- Its simple to learn
- one can achieve more by writing few codes of lines
- its interpreted ,its doesnot require interpreter
- its support procedural language,functional and object oriented programming language
python has two version python2 and python3 ,python3 is the recomended version because of updates
### to check if python exists and version of python 
python --version
## To interact with output
we use print function() followed by either single qoute or double qoute to output information on python file.

`print("hello ,world" )`

`print("hello, my name is silas" )`

`print("hello ,am learning python )`

print(3) #numbers are not enclosed in qoutation unless you want to ouput as string

## comments in python
- comments : allows you to describe what your program is doing
  
or

- what some part of code mean 

or 
- put some kind of meaning to your code 

commenst can be written as single line comment or double line comment
## single line comment

single line comment use #

#this is a single line comment

`print("what is python programming")`


## multiline comment


multine line comment use single tripe qoute or double triple qoute


"""
`print("hello ,today am learning python programming")`
"""


## variables

variable are containers which are used to store data or some information

example

- name='silas sakwa'
age=67
country ="kenya"

- name is a variable that stores information about silas

- age=67 age is a vraiable that stores the age 67
country is a variable that store kenya

we can use print function() to output the value of variables

example
name="silas sakwa"

`print(name)'
``` output
silas
```

example 2
```
customer="Kate"

product="Iphone 3"

price=100000

print(customer)

print(prouct)

print(price)

```

output

```kate```

```iphone 3```

```100000```


## let learn how to output using formatted output


```
customer="Kate"

product="Iphone 3"

price=100000
```

``` print(f"Customer name:{} product purchased{} at ksh {}".format(customer,product,price)```

output

```customer name Kate product purchased Iphone 3 at ksh 100000 ```

another way of printing formated output is using concatation means(+)

``` print("Customer name is " +customer)```

``` print("Product is " +product)```

``` print("price  " +price)```

``` print("Price " +  str (price))```

## Typecasting
used to know type of data stored in a container

also used to change a value of a variable from one state to another

- customer_name="Kate"

- Prodcut_Pucharsed="Itel 05"

- price=10000

- height=11.7

```print(type(height))```

output

float

print(type(customer_name))

output

str

print(type(price))

output

price
